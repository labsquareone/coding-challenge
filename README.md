## Instructions

- Use TypeScript, React, and CSS(styled component or any other CSS library accepted) to complete the following prompt.

 Do not use any state management (redux).
 (Testing libraries are fine!!)

## Prompt

 You run a restaurant selling sandwiches and need some way of keeping track of orders.
 Create a React app that allows your employees to create new orders and show them when they've been picked up.

 1.  Create a form where a user can create orders.
 - A user should be able to see each sandwich and how much they cost.
 - A user should be able to add sandwiches to the order using a button.
 - A user should not be able to add a sandwich we don't have ingredients for (see data.json).
 - A user should be able to see all items in an order.
 - A user should be able to see the total cost of the order.
 - A user should be able to complete the order using a button.

 2.  Create a component that displays all active orders.
 - A user should be able to see all "open" orders.
 - A user should be able to uniquely identify orders from one another.
 - A user should be able to see all items in an order.
 - A user should be able to see the total cost of the order.
 - A user should be able to mark the order as "picked-up" by clicking a button.
 - A user should be able to clearly distinguish "open" and "picked-up" orders.

# Happy Coding!
